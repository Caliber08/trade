            <h2>It Seems</h2>
            <p>Current MMOs are crowded with characters who
            are deadlocked on a personal storyline. The MUDs of old encouraged users
            to interact and contribute not just in a specific quest or raid but for
            mutual benefit and social fulfillment. As chat rooms became fantastic
            worlds we see more and more of our avatars and less and less of each other.

            <p class="lead"> 
            <span class="label label-primary">Trade</span> is a game that allows a user
            to coach a character (or set of characters) through advanced development. It
            is, in part, a survival game, but seeks to be a game in which characters
            find new ways to thrive.</p>
            <h3>Basics</h3>
            <p>
                All entities in the <span class="label label-primary">Trade</span>
                world act with an intelligence. Each strives to survive, grow,
                and thrive based on some universal goals and a few specific ones.
                When a user is playing, her will suppresses (to some extent) the
                will of the active character.
